# Web-Scraper
Basic Web Scraper Implementation: Build a simple Node.js scraper using either Puppeteer or Playwright. Target a sample website (e.g., quotes.toscrape.com, or any job board, e-commerce site). Extract structured data (title, price, image URL, etc.). Output to console or save as JSON/CSV.
